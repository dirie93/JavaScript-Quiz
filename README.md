# JavaScript-Quiz

 
In this project, I created a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions using JavaScript, where the user is tested on some basic fundementals of the programming language

## User-Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

```

## Reflection 

 * I developed a better understanding of initialising variables and declaring them.
 
 * I was able to strengthen my understanding of event listeners

 * I was able to challenge myself and implement timers and use logic whereby countdowns were truggered only at specified intervals

 * Better understanding of debugging. I had to use the console.log() at several points, one issued that persisted was the 'next' button not working despite the user answering a question. I later found out I did not have the required event listener.
